"""
A user-friendly script designed to interface with the OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API.
It provides an efficient way to analyze images using AI, 
with capabilities extending to real-time analysis via webcam integration.
This code file is structured to be easily understandable and modifiable, 
catering to both beginners and experienced programmers. 
Its primary function is to capture images, convert them into a suitable format, 
and leverage GPT-4's advanced algorithms for detailed image analysis. 
Perfect for projects in AI-driven image recognition and data processing
